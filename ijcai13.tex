\section{Introduction}

\section{General Test Game}

A \emph{test game} $G = (A, \mathbb B, m, t, p)$ consists of a set of potential
problems $A = \{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\}$ to test and $k$ types of test takers
$\mathbb B = \{B_1, B_2, \ldots, B_k\}$ that may participate the test. The
$l$-th type test takers has an unsolvable problem set $B_l \subseteq A$. The
memorize capacity function $m: \mathbb B \rightarrow \mathbb N$ denotes how
many problems a particular test taker can memorize. During the test, $t$ out of
$n$ problems will be tested and a particular test taker will pass the test if
each of those tested problems is either not in the unsolvable problem set or
memorized. 

The \emph{test game} is a 2-player Bayes game between the tester and
the test taker where the test taker's type is uncertain. Let $p_l$ be the
probability that type-$l$ test taker occurs. The game has only two outcomes,
pass or fail.

\subsection{Hardness on Test Size}

\subsection{Hardness on Memorize Capacity}

\begin{theorem}
Even if test size is $2$, \textsc{Optimal Test Strategy} is coNP-hard when
memorize capacity is non-constant.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
We reduce \textsc{Independent Set} instances to test games with test size $2$
and ask the complementary question: is $u$ the highest utility that the tester
can get. That question has a yes answer if and only if the dual minimax LP
[reference] has a feasible solution with objective at most $u$. For a graph $G
= (V, E)$, let $V$ be our test problem set. Add $|E|+|V|+2$ types of test
takers as follows:

\begin{itemize}

\item For each edge $e = (v_i, v_j) \in E$, add one type of test takers $l_e$
with tester utility equals $1$ if they fail and $0$ if they pass. This type of
test takers cannot solve only two problems, $v_i, v_j$. The number of problems
they can memorize is 0.

\item For each vertex $v$, we add one type of test takers $l_v$ with tester utility
equals $d_G-d(v)$ if they fail and 0 if they pass. Here $d_G$ is the maximum
vertex degree in $G$ and $d(v)$ is the degree of vertex $v$. This type of test
takers cannot solve only one problem $v$ and the number of problems they can
memorize is 0.

\item Add one auxiliary type of test takers $l_A$ with tester utility equals
$a \cdot \varepsilon$ if they fail and $0$ if they pass where $a =
\binom{|V|}{2}-|E|-\binom{k}{2}$. This type of test takers cannot solve any
problems but they can memorize $2$.

\item Finally, add one type of test takers $l_K$ with tester utility equals
$u^{l_K} = \varepsilon$ if they fail and $0$ if they pass. This type of test
takers cannot solve any problems but they can memorize $k$ of them.

\end{itemize}

Then we show that deciding whether $u = (2 d_G + a\cdot \varepsilon)/L$ is an
upper-bound for the tester's utility, or equivalently whether we can find a
dual solution with objective as low as $u = (2 d_G + a\cdot \varepsilon)/L$ in
our dual minimax LP, is equivalent to finding a size-$k$ independent set in
$G$. Recall that a dual solution is a strategy for test takers to memorize
problems. If no one memorizes, the tester's utility $U_r$ to test a problem set
$r$ is $U_r = (2d_G+a\cdot\varepsilon + \varepsilon) /L$ if $r \notin E$ and
$U_r = (2d_G-1+a\cdot\varepsilon + \varepsilon)/L$ if $r \in E$. To lower
the objective, test takers $l_A, l_K$ should memorize problem sets that bring the
maximum of $U_r$ down.  No matter what the strategy is (as long as they only
memorize unsolvable problems), $\sum_r U_r$ is a constant. And because $U_r$
for $r \notin E$ is much larger than $U_r$ for $r \in E$ in terms of
$\varepsilon$, it's better to only decrease $U_r$ for $r \notin E$. The only
way to do that is to let $l_A$ test takers only memorize pairs of problems
that are not edges and let $l_K$ test takers only memorize size-$k$ indepedent
sets of problems.  If there's a size-$k$ independent set, let $l_K$ test takers
memorize one size-$k$ independent set all the time and let $l_A$ test takers
memorize all pairs of problems that are not covered by that independent set with
uniform probability. That will make $U_r = (2d_G+a\cdot\varepsilon)/L$ for $r
\notin E$ and $U_r = (2d_G-1+a\cdot\varepsilon+\varepsilon)/L$ for $r \in E$.
This is the best they can achieve and this can only be achieved when a size-$k$
independent set exists in $G$.

\end{proof}

\section{\LaTeX{} and Word Style Files}\label{stylefiles}

The \LaTeX{} and Word style files are available on the IJCAI--13
website, {\tt http://www.ijcai-13.org/}.
These style files implement the formatting instructions in this
document.

The \LaTeX{} files are {\tt ijcai13.sty} and {\tt ijcai13.tex}, and
the Bib\TeX{} files are {\tt named.bst} and {\tt ijcai13.bib}. The
\LaTeX{} style file is for version 2e of \LaTeX{}, and the Bib\TeX{}
style file is for version 0.99c of Bib\TeX{} ({\em not} version
0.98i). The {\tt ijcai13.sty} file is the same as the {\tt
ijcai07.sty} file used for IJCAI--07.

The Microsoft Word style file consists of a single file, {\tt
ijcai13.doc}. This template is the same as the one used for
IJCAI--07.

These Microsoft Word and \LaTeX{} files contain the source of the
present document and may serve as a formatting sample.  

Further information on using these styles for the preparation of
papers for IJCAI--13 can be obtained by contacting {\tt
pcchair13@ijcai.org}.
